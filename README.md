This project contains the conversion process and status from Auxy sound packs into other uses as Ableton Sampler/Drum Rack instruments for MIDI control and other uses using a the iOS [Auxy Pro](https://auxy.co/) music app, a custom [AHK script](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and [Ableton Live 11](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/).

* **NOTE:**
> #### **Unfortunately, due to the licensing restrictions of Auxy and their respective copyright holders, the audio samples/Ableton presets cannot be provided.**
> #### **This is just the AHK script used to convert from Auxy samples to a basic Ableton Sampler instrument.**

# Project Status Stages:

> ## **Tuning:** 
> Ensuring each instrument plays the same frequency on the same note.

> ## **Sustain:**
> Maintains a consistent sustained loop when holding notes.

> ## **Volume:**
> Keeps all instruments at a consistent volume and normalised between them.

> ## **Extra:**
> Creating a blend between Tone/Shape and other features of instruments similar to Auxy's methods.

> ## **Finished:**
> This is the final step that is as closely emulating Auxy as possible in Ableton as far as I know.
